                On the list of things Temitope Dada (known popularly as
                Oluwadabest) is passionate about, the art and act of
                storytelling comes tops. This is why my works as a commercial
                and documentary filmmaker always have a peculiar feel to them;
                one that can only be birthed by Dabest.

                Based in Lagos yet having worked with multinational brands, I
                lead the creative team at FilmbyDT Production Company and I am
                passionate about teaching; expressing this as a tutor/convenor
                at Shoot Edit Repeat â€” a training for cinematography enthusiasts
                nationwide.
